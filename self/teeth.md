### Toothbrush
Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5100 Gum Health Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush

#### Notes
I grabbed this from Target to replace an old Philips Sonicare toothbrush. This one
is a little fancier than my old one. And it came in a pretty blue color.

### Toothpaste
Fluoridex Sensitivity Relief Prescription-Strength Anticavity Toothpaste

#### Notes
My dentist prescribed this to me because my teeth enamel has a lot of decay. Brush
your teeth!!!
